Here is a SQL query that involves finding duplicates for the customer table:

SELECT
        customer_id,
        store_id,
        first_name,
        email,
        address_id,
        activebool,
        create_date,
        last_update,
        active,
        COUNT(*)
FROM customer
GROUP BY 
        customer_id,
        store_id,
        first_name,
        email,
        address_id,
        activebool,
        create_date,
        last_update,
        active
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
