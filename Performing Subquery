Here is a SQL query that includes a subquery to find top 5 customers within each country:

SELECT
    D. country,
    COUNT(DISTINCT A.customer_id) AS all_customer_count,
    COUNT(top_5_customers) AS top_customer_count
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id - B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
LEFT JOIN
(SELECT
    A. customer_id,
    A. first_name,
    A. last_name,
    C. city,
    D. country,
SUM (E.amount) AS total_amount_paid
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id - B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
INNER JOIN payment E ON A.customer_id = E.customer_id
WHERE C. city IN ('Aurora, 'Acua', 'Citrus Heights', 'Iwaki', 'Ambattur',
                    'Shanwei', 'So Leopoldo', 'Teboksary', 'Tianjin', 'Cianjur')
GROUP BY
    A. customer_id,
    A. first_name,
    A. last_name,
    C. city,
    D. country
ORDER BY total_amount_paid DESC
LIMIT 5) AS average
