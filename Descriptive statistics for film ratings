Here is a SQL query calculating descriptive statistics for specific film ratings:

SELECT
COUNT(film_id) AS count_of_movies,
AVG(rental_rate) AS average_movie_rental_rate,
MAX(rental_duration) AS maximum_rental_duration,
MIN(rental_duration) AS minimum_rental_duration,
FROM film
WHERE rating IN('PG', 'G')
