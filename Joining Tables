Here is a SQL query where tables were joined to find the top 5 customers from the top 10 cities whoâ€™ve paid the highest total amounts to Rockbuster:

SELECT
    A. customer_id,
    A. first_name,
    A. last_name,
    C. city,
    D. country,
SUM (E.amount) AS total_amount_paid
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
INNER JOIN payment E ON A.customer_id = E.customer_id
WHERE C. city IN ('Aurora', 'Acua', 'Citrus Heights', 'Iwaki', 'Ambattur', 'Shanwei', 
                  'So, Leopoldo', 'Teboksary', 'Tianjin', 'Cianjur')
GROUP BY 
    A. customer_id,
    A. first_name,
    A. last_name,
    C. city,
    D. country
ORDER BY total_amount_paid DESC
LIMIT 5
